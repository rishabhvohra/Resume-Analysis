# Resume-Analysis
This repository proposes job seeker and employer login. 
In this the recruitment process is simple and efficient by integrating web crawling, text mining, and natural language processing techniques. 
This is implemented using collaborative filtering algorithm. Also, to optimize the storage space for the service provider it proposes de-duplication technique avoiding replication of files. 
For de-duplication technique it uses Proactive Replica Checking approach (PRCR). 
Also applying natural processing techniques saves time and provides effective results in both job seeker and employer side. 
Web crawler is used to extract job description and requirements in the employer side. 
Whereas in the job seeker side, stop word filtering and text segmentation is performed after the resume is posted in the portal.
